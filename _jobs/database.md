While being present in Iasi for more than 15 years, for the last couple of years we are having a fresh start building a suite of innovative new products.

We are looking for a junior DB Developer who will collaborate and grow with a team building complex user interfaces and specific components for a new software product.

## This is you:
 - Proactive — You are a collaborative team player who likes to build on ideas and innovate.
 - Agile — You are an agile planner who delivers fast results, quickly learns and continuously drives improvements.
 - Detail-oriented – You love being “down in the weeds” with the details of your work.

 - have a good understanding of how the web works.

## This is us:
 - Entrepreneurial — An entrepreneurial culture where you are encouraged to try new ideas and to quickly fail in the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement.
 - Innovative — A team of smart colleagues that challenges status quo and shares a passion to innovate, be the best, and win.
 - Visionary — A place where you are expected to make an impact at all levels and to redefine the box — not just think outside of it.
